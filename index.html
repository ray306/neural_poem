      <p>Poetry is universally and deeply rooted in human cultures (Turner and Pöppel, 1983; 1988). Its genres and forms, however, are subject to considerable cross-cultural/cross-linguistic and historical variation, e.g., with respect to the formal and thematic constraints they impose on the composition of lines and stanzas (Fabb, 2015). But dDespite this enormous diversity, many poetic forms and genres are uniquely and consistently structured, and they allow only limited variation of their general form. For example, the Shakespearean sonnet comprises 14 lines of iambic pentameter that are formally and thematically grouped into three four-line stanzas (i.e., quatrains) and one couplet. Jueju (Chinese quatrain), a poetic form that dates back to the Tang period (618–907 A.D.), comprises four lines, each of which consists of five monosyllabic words, and usually exhibits systematic end-rhyme and tonal patterns across sentences (Cai, 2008). This strict formal and thematic structure distinguishes poetry both from everyday speech and from other literary genres (e.g. narrative prose or drama), and raises an interesting question: how does this structural constraint aid in conveying the poetic significance and affect listeners’ aesthetic experience? To investigate this question, we take an interdisciplinary approach that combines cognitive neuroscience with artificial intelligence and crowdsourcing.
