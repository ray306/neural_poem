      <blockquote>
      <p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. (Wikipedia)</p>
      </blockquote>
      The neural responses were measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while native Chinese speakers listened to the artificial poems presented as an isochronous sequence of syllables that were synthesized individually (to eliminate prosodic cues and pauses between phrases or sentences). 
      </br></br>   
      Before the MEG recording, participants were required to read all the selected 180 poems. They were asked the question ‘how good is the poem’ in Chinese and rated the poems from 1 (bad) to 3 (good). This procedure lasted about 5-10 minutes and aimed to familiarize the participants with the poetic structure but prevented them from memorizing the poems. The 180 poems were displayed in four Excel sheets and the order of sheets for rating was counter-balanced among the participants. 
      </br></br> 
      During the MEG recording, participants were presented each poem twice and rated the poems from 1 (bad) to 3 (good) after the second presentation by pressing one of three buttons using their right hand. On each trial, participants were first required to focus on a white fixation in the center of a black screen. After 2.5 ~ 3.5 s, the fixation disappeared and one poem stimulus was presented. After the poem stimulus was over, the white fixation reappeared. The same poem was presented again 1 s later. After the second presentation, a question in Chinese, ‘how good is the poem?’, was displayed on the screen and the participants were required to rate the poem by pressing a button. The next trial started in 2.5 ~ 3.5 s after the button press. The procedure was illustrated in Figure 1D. The poem stimuli were presented in three blocks and the order of the poems was randomized for each participant.
